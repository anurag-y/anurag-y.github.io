            <h1>Hi, I am Anurag.</h1>
            <p>Hi there! My name is Anurag, and I am a final semester student of Electronics and Communication Engineering at IIT Guwahati.
                I am incredibly passionate about technology and its application and fascinated by its power to change the world.
                I am always on the lookout for anything that interests me - books, blogs, tweets, articles, documentaries, you name it!<br>
                I also enjoy writing and have a keen interest in current technological developments, especially in the field of GenAI, which I am actively trying to learn more about.
                Apart from my love for technology, I am also a music enthusiast and consider it my ultimate drug.
                While I mostly listen to music, I am also learning to play some instruments.<br>
                Lastly but least, I have a keen interest in Philosophy and History, which I love to explore in my free time.
            
                <br><br>
